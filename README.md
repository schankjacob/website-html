# HTML

I've learned a lot about how a webpage is structured. It's cool to use that format to create a design I like.

# CSS

I've learned a lot about making a webpage responsively look good. I think this part may be my favorite part of building a webpage. I love figuring out how to design something beautiful by isolating and modifying specific elements.

# JavaScript

I've learned how to implement more traditional coding ideas into my website. I've learned how to use anonymous functions, and how to modify the DOM.
